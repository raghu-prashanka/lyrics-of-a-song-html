    <pre>Lyrics
        When the days are cold
        And the cards all fold
        And the saints we see are all made of gold
        When your dreams all fail
        And the ones we hail
        Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
        
        I wanna hide the truth
        I wanna shelter you
        But with the beast inside
        There's nowhere we can hide
        No matter what we breed
        We still are made of greed
        This is my kingdom come
        This is my kingdom come
        
        When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
        Don't get too close, it's dark inside
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
        
        At the curtain's call
        It's the last of all
        When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
        So they dug your grave
        And the masquerade
        Will come calling out at the mess you've made
        
        Don't wanna let you down
        But I am hell-bound
        Though this is all for you
        Don't wanna hide the truth
        No matter what we breed
        We still are made of greed
        This is my kingdom come
        This is my kingdom come
        
        When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
        Don't get too close, it's dark inside
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
        
        They say it's what you make
        I say it's up to fate
        It's woven in my soul
        I need to let you go
        Your eyes, they shine so bright
        I wanna save that light
        I can't escape this now
        Unless you show me how
        
        When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
        Don't get too close, it's dark inside
        It's where my demons hide
        It's where my demons hide
